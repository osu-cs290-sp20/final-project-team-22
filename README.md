# final-project-team-22

Hey guys, I set up a good part of the server side skeleton and it should work pretty well when adding new html. The set-up is very similar to Hess's example code for the star wars page. Eveything in the script should automatically build when you run 'npm start'. 

Yuhi - You'll notice I removed the .jpg and instead stored urls in a .json. This is so that the .jpg are not hardcoded and adding new cities into .json is pretty easy. In server.js I left a comment about how a random city is chosen. The page also redirects to /start when the game is started.

I hope this direction works for you guys and like I said, it is just a skeleton so feel free to change whatever. Of coruse I'll still be working on it and I left some comments that hopefully help explain some changes.
